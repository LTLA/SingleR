\section{Version 1.6.0}{\itemize{
\item Relaxed the requirements for consistent row names in \code{combineRecomputedResults()}.
}}

\section{Version 1.4.0}{\itemize{
\item Migrated all of the dataset getter functions to the \pkg{celldex} package.

\item Streamlined the vignette to point to the book at \url{http://bioconductor.org/books/devel/SingleRBook/}.

\item Added a \code{restrict=} argument to \code{trainSingleR()} and \code{SingleR()} to easily restrict to a subset of features.

\item Deprecated the \code{method=} argument in \code{SingleR()}.

\item Protect against accidental data.frames in \code{ref=} or \code{test=} in all functions.
}}

\section{Version 1.2.0}{\itemize{
\item Added support for consolidating labels from multiple references via \code{combineResults()}.

\item Added mappings to standardized Cell Ontology terms in all \code{*Data()} functions.

\item Changed the name of the \code{labels} input of \code{plotScoreDistribution()} to \code{labels.use} for consistency across functions.

\item Fixed a label from adipocytes to astrocytes in \code{BlueprintEncodeData()}.

\item Removed umlauts from labels (e.g., naive) in \code{NovershternHematopoieticData()} to avoid problems with Windows.

\item Perform PCA before clustering in \code{aggregateReference()} for speed and memory efficiency.

\item Modified \code{genes="all"} behavior in \code{trainSingleR()} to report DE-based markers for fine-tuning only.
}}

\section{Version 1.0.0}{\itemize{
\item New package SingleR for cell type annotation.
}}
