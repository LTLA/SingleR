#' Aggregate reference samples
#'
#' Aggregate reference samples for a given label by averaging their count profiles.
#' This can be done with varying degrees of resolution to preserve the within-label heterogeneity.
#'
#' @param ref A numeric matrix of reference expression values, usually containing log-expression values.
#' Alternatively, a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} object containing such a matrix.
#' @param labels A character vector or factor of known labels for all cells in \code{ref}.
#' @param ncenters Integer scalar specifying the maximum number of aggregated profiles to produce for each label.
#' @param power Numeric scalar between 0 and 1 indicating how much aggregation should be performed, see Details.
#' @param rank Integer scalar specfiying the number of principal components to use during clustering.
#' @param assay.type An integer scalar or string specifying the assay of \code{ref} containing the relevant expression matrix,
#' if \code{ref} is a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} object.
#' @param subset.row Integer, character or logical vector indicating the rows of \code{ref} to use for k-means clustering. 
#' @param check.missing Logical scalar indicating whether rows should be checked for missing values (and if found, removed).
#' @param BPPARAM A \linkS4class{BiocParallelParam} object indicating how parallelization should be performed.
#' @param BSPARAM A \linkS4class{BiocSingularParam} object indicating which SVD algorithm should be used in \code{\link{runPCA}}.

#' @details
#' With single-cell reference datasets, it is often useful to aggregate individual cells into pseudo-bulk samples to serve as a reference.
#' This improves speed in downstream assignment with \code{\link{classifySingleR}} or \code{\link{SingleR}}.
#' The most obvious aggregation is to simply average all counts for all cells in a label to obtain a single pseudo-bulk profile.
#' However, this discards information about the within-label heterogeneity (e.g., the \dQuote{shape} and spread of the population in expression space)
#' that may be informative for assignment, especially for closely related labels.
#'
#' The default approach in this function is to create a series of pseudo-bulk samples to represent each label.
#' This is achieved by performing vector quantization via k-means clustering on all cells in a particular label.
#' Cells in each cluster are subsequently averaged to create one pseudo-bulk sample that serves as a representative for that location in the expression space.
#' This reduces the number of separate observations (for speed) while preserving some level of population heterogeneity (for fidelity).
#' 
#' The number of pseudo-bulk samples per label is controlled by \code{ncenters}.
#' By default, we set the number of clusters to \code{X^power} where \code{X} is the number of cells for that label.
#' This ensures that labels with more cells have more resolved representatives.
#' If \code{ncenters} is greater than the number of samples for a label and/or \code{power=1}, no aggregation is performed.
#' Setting \code{power=0} will aggregate all cells of a label into a single pseudo-bulk profile.
#'
#' k-means clustering is actually performed on the first \code{rank} principal components as computed using \code{\link{runPCA}}.
#' The use of PCs compacts the data for more efficient operation of \code{\link{kmeans}};
#' it also removes some of the high-dimensional noise to highlight major factors of within-label heterogenity.
#' Note that the PCs are only used for clustering and the full expression profiles are still used for the final averaging.
#' Users can disable the PCA step by setting \code{rank=Inf}.
#'
#' Setting \code{subset.row} to an appropriate indexing vector will subset the matrix by gene prior to PCA.
#' However, again, the aggregation is performed on the full expression profiles.
#' This option may be useful for clustering based on known genes of interest but retaining all genes in the aggregated results.
#'
#' We use the average rather than the sum in order to be compatible with \code{\link{trainSingleR}}'s internal marker detection.
#' Moreover, unlike counts, the sum of transformed and normalized expression values generally has little meaning.
#' We do not use the median to avoid consistently obtaining zeros for lowly expressed genes.
#' 
#' @return
#' A \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} object with a \code{"logcounts"} assay containing a matrix of aggregated expression values,
#' and a \code{label} column metadata field specifying the label corresponding to each column.
